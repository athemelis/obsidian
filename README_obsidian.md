## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Guide

### **Query Tool Usage**

1. **Building a Query**:
   - Use the visual builder to add conditions
   - Combine with AND/OR/NOT operators
   - Or switch to "Query Editor" tab to write directly
   - **New**: Watch for red highlighting if query is invalid

2. **Query Operators**:
   - **equals** - exact match
   - **contains** - substring match
   - **startsWith** - prefix match
   - **endsWith** - suffix match
   - **exists** - property has a non-empty value (NEW)
   - **does not exist** - property is missing or empty (NEW)

3. **Example Queries**:
   ```
   Obsidian equals "[[ü¶ã Categories]]"
   
   Category equals "[[üè¢ Companies]]" AND Status equals "Active"
   
   (Type equals "Project" OR Type equals "Task") AND NOT Status equals "Completed"
   
   Stakeholder does not exist
   
   Stakeholder exists AND Team equals "Engineering"
   
   (Stakeholder does not exist OR Stakeholder equals "") AND Priority equals "High"
   ```

4. **Using Existence Operators** (NEW):
   - Select property name (e.g., "Stakeholder")
   - Choose "exists" or "does not exist" from operator dropdown
   - Value field automatically disables (no value needed)
   - Click "Add Condition"
   - Useful for finding notes missing required properties

5. **Adding New Properties**:
   - Leave "Original Value" empty
   - Choose property type from dropdown
   - Enter new value according to type format

6. **Property Types**:
   - **Text**: Single string value
   - **List**: Comma-separated values (becomes YAML list)
   - **Number**: Numeric value
   - **Checkbox**: true/false
   - **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD format
   - **DateTime**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format

7. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - **Enter** in property name ‚Üí Focus value field
   - **Enter** in value field ‚Üí Add condition
   - **Ctrl/Cmd + Z** ‚Üí Undo last change
   - **Ctrl/Cmd + Y** or **Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z** ‚Üí Redo
   - **Ctrl/Cmd + Enter** ‚Üí Execute query
   - **Escape** ‚Üí Clear current inputs

8. **Import/Export Queries**:
   - Click "Export All Queries" to save queries to JSON file
   - Click "Import Queries" to load queries from file
   - Choose to add to existing queries or replace all

### **Search & Replace Usage**

1. **Search Patterns**:
   - Use `*` for any number of characters
   - Use `?` for single character
   - Example: `TODO*` finds "TODO", "TODO:", "TODO list", etc.

2. **Wikilink Protection**:
   - Check "Exclude matches within wikilinks" to preserve [[links]]
   - Example: Won't replace "Project" in "[[Project Management]]"

3. **Workflow**:
   - Select target folder
   - Enter search pattern
   - Preview results
   - Enter replacement text
   - Preview changes
   - Apply changes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Python 3.6+**
- **macOS** (tested on macOS with zsh)
- **Packages** (auto-installed by start script):
  - Flask
  - flask-cors
  - PyYAML

## üîí Safety Features

1. **Automatic Backups**: Every modification creates a timestamped backup
2. **Preview Mode**: See exactly what will change before applying
3. **Backup Retention**: Keeps last 3 backups to prevent disk space issues
4. **Change Logging**: Complete audit trail of all modifications
5. **Query Validation**: Prevents execution of invalid queries (v2.0)
6. **Undo/Redo**: Revert query changes easily (v2.0)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
- Check if port 5001-5002 are in use
- Verify Python 3 is installed: `python3 --version`
- Check permissions on start script: `chmod +x start_server.sh`

### Can't see property type selector
- Click "Show/Hide Type" button next to Original Value field
- Ensure Original Value field is completely empty

### Saved queries disappeared
- Check if `saved_queries.json` exists in the script directory
- Queries are saved per-directory, not per-vault
- Use the export feature to backup queries

### Connection errors
- Ensure the server is running (check terminal)
- Try refreshing the browser
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Query validation errors (v2.0)
- Red highlighting indicates syntax errors
- Check for unmatched parentheses
- Ensure queries don't end with operators
- Validate operator sequences

### Button click errors (v2.2)
- If AND/OR/NOT buttons show "not defined" errors, hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure no browser extensions are interfering

## üí° Tips

1. **Query Reuse**: Save frequently used queries for quick access
2. **Test First**: Use "Modify First File" to test changes on one file
3. **Wildcards**: Use `*` liberally in searches, e.g., `*TODO*`
4. **Backup Location**: Configure backup path to a cloud-synced folder for extra safety
5. **Complex Queries**: Use parentheses to group conditions properly
6. **Keyboard Efficiency**: Learn the shortcuts for faster query building
7. **Query Sharing**: Export queries to share with team members
8. **Version Control**: Export queries before major vault changes
9. **Finding Missing Properties**: Use "does not exist" to audit your vault for missing metadata
10. **Property Cleanup**: Combine "exists" with other conditions to find and fix incomplete notes

## üÜï What's New in v2.2

### Property Existence Operators
- **"exists" operator**: Finds notes where property has any non-empty value
- **"does not exist" operator**: Finds notes where property is missing, null, or empty
- Value field automatically disabled when these operators are selected
- Works with all property types (text, list, number, etc.)
- Perfect for finding notes missing required metadata

### Technical Improvements
- Fixed JavaScript scope issues with button handlers
- Moved critical functions to global scope for reliability
- Cleaned up debugging code for better performance
